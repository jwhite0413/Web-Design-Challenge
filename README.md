# Web-Design-Challenge
For this challenge, I developed a Web dashboard using Boostrap themes to show various weather data across the world. 
Within each page of the site, there is an image displayed,along with a short analysis. Each image is clickable and there is a navbar on each page that allows you to navigate to various areas of the website.
Inside the repository, you will find the main index.html file, along with corresponding boostrap files and images.
Note -There were some difficulties getting the page to load in GitHub Pages but after creating the second branch (gh-pages) I was sucessful.
